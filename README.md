#Dragon Tale

###Overview
A game in Java I made by following a Youtube tutorial by ForeignGuyMike, who created all assets and virtually all the code.
This can serve as a good framework and example to build from for future games.

All game files are in the DragonTale directory and run DragonTale.jar to play the game!
