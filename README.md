#Dragon Tale

###Overview
A game in Java I made by following a Youtube tutorial. All assets and virtually all code were created by ForeignGuyMike.
This can serve as a good framework and example to build from for future games.

All game files are in the DragonTale directory and DragonTale.jar will run the game.
